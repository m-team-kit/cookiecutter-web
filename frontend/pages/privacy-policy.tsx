        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p>This privacy policy for Templates Hub service is effective from 2023-09-20</p>
        <br />
        <h2>Service</h2>
        <p>
            Templates Hub provides a Hub to collect software templates based on{' '}
            <a href="https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter">cookiecuters</a> and to generate
            software projects from them. Users can add new templates, search, list them, choose a
            template of their preference, fill out the corresponding web form and, when submitted,
            receive a zip file containing a customized startup software project. The Templates Hub
            service consists of the Python backend compliant with the OpenAPI specification and the
            frontend to provide the web GUI. The template records are collected in the github
            repository and cached in the database local to the service.
        </p>
        <p>
            The service is provided by the <a href="https://www.scc.kit.edu/en/">Scientific Computing Center</a> (SCC){' '}
